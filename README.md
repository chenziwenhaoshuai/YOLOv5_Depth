# YOLOv5_Depth
YOLOv5_Depth: use YOLOv5 to detect depth image
## Intrduction
This project uses YOLOv5 as the baseline and realsense D435i to detect the depth map and give the depth of field where the target is located.
## Result
We used puffer fish as the experimental subject and gave the effect graph of the detection in '. /experiment_iamge/'
